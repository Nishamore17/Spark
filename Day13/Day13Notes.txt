  
  SPARK ON YARN
1. SCHEDULING POLICY
2. MPP WITH FAULT TOLERANCE
3. BOTH SMALL JOBS AND BIG JOBS CAN SHARE THE RESOURCES
4. HETEROGENIOUS

pyspark  --master=yarn --deploy-mode=client --> driver sits at client side
pyspark  --master=yarn --deploy-mode=cluster --> driver sits within cluster executor

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPARK JOBS CAN BE VIEWED USING SPARK UIs [driver]

note: we can see UI only when u rin spark shell [REPL] or when spark job is running [Batch]

SPARK UI WITHOUT YARN --> <thrift sever> :4040 
SPARK WITH YARN --> resource manager webui --> <resource manager>:8088 --> Application master --> sparkUI

SCHEDULER
1. Fair scheduler
2. Capacity scheduler

WHERNEVER A JOB IS SUBMITTED BY A USER, THE JOB GOES TO A POOL [QUEUE]
WE CAN DEFINE EXPLICT POOLS AND SET RESOURCE RESTRICTIONS TO THE POOL AND ASSOCIATE THE POOL TO THE USER. [POOL OR QUEUE]
 EXECUTION PLAN
LOGICAL PLAN:  RBO
PHYSICAL PLAN: CBO
